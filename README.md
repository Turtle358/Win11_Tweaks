# Win11_Tweaks
Removes edge from windows and makes some other changes
# For Windows 11
- Removes edge completely
- Restores win10 context (right click) menu
- Prevents Further edge updates (Hopefully)
- **Edge may required to be force stopped in task manager**

# For Tiny11
- Removes the remainders of edge (often in the form of widgets)
- Restores win10 context (right click) menu
- Prevents further edge updates (Hopefully)
